Sign In
=======

Overview
--------

The sign-in feature allows users to access their accounts securely. This section explains the implementation and usage of the sign-in function within the Flutter application.

Usage
-----

The sign-in page provides a familiar authentication interface with the following features:

- **Username and Password Fields**: Users enter their credentials to authenticate.
- **Password Visibility Toggle**: Users can show or hide their password input for convenience.
- **Sign In Button**: Submits the credentials for validation.
- **Error Feedback**: If the credentials are invalid, an error message is displayed.

The sign-in process is structured as follows:

1. **Navigate to the Sign In Page**  
   Users are presented with the sign-in screen as the app is launched or when authentication is required.

2. **Enter Credentials**  
   Users input their username and password.

3. **Submit Form**  
   Upon pressing the "Sign In" button, the app validates the credentials using the authentication engine.

4. **Feedback**  
   If authentication is successful, the user is redirected to the home page. If it fails, an error message is shown.

Maintenance
-----------

**How the Software Works:**

- The `SignInPage` widget manages the sign-in UI and logic.
- The `SignInFormWidget` handles user input for username and password, including validation and password visibility.
- The `_handleSignIn` method in `_SignInPageState` retrieves the input, calls the authentication engine, and updates the UI based on the result.
- Error messages are shown using a `SnackBar` if authentication fails.
- The design follows Flutter's best practices for stateful widgets and form validation.

API Documentation
-----------------

While the current implementation uses a local authentication engine, a typical API endpoint for sign-in might look like:

.. code-block:: http

   POST /api/signin HTTP/1.1
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
       "username": "your_username",
       "password": "your_password"
   }


Features
--------------

- **Simple and Clear UI**: Only essential fields are shown to minimize friction.
- **Immediate Feedback**: Users receive instant feedback on authentication success or failure.
- **Secure Handling**: Password fields are obscured by default, and sensitive actions are confirmed with user feedback.
- **Extensible Architecture**: The code is modular and can be extended to integrate with various authentication providers.
