Sign In
=======

Overview
--------

The sign-in feature allows users to access their accounts securely. This section explains how to implement and use the sign-in functionality.

### Requirements

- **Username and Password**: Users must have a valid username and password to sign in.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Optional, but recommended for enhanced security.

### Sign In Process

1. **Navigate to the Sign In Page**: Users should go to the designated sign-in page.
2. **Enter Credentials**: Input your username and password in the respective fields.
3. **Submit Form**: Click the "Sign In" button to submit the form.
4. **Authentication**: The system verifies the credentials. If valid, the user is redirected to the home page.

### Error Handling

- **Invalid Credentials**: If the username or password is incorrect, an error message is displayed.
- **Account Lockout**: After multiple failed attempts, the account may be temporarily locked for security reasons.

### API Documentation

If you are implementing the sign-in feature programmatically, refer to the following API endpoints:

.. code-block:: http
   POST /api/signin HTTP/1.1
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
       "username": "your_username",
       "password": "your_password"
   }

### Troubleshooting

- **Forgot Password**: Users can reset their password using the "Forgot Password" link on the sign-in page.
- **Account Issues**: Contact support if you encounter any issues with your account.

### Security Considerations

- **Use HTTPS**: Ensure all communication is encrypted using HTTPS.
- **Password Storage**: Passwords should be stored securely using a strong hashing algorithm.

### Example Code
